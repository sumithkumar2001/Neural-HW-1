1.	What patterns do you observe in the training and validation accuracy curves?
ANS: The training accuracy increases over time, showing that the model is learning. 
     The validation accuracy may also improve but can go up and down due to overfitting. 
     If the training accuracy is much higher than the validation accuracy, the model is overfitting.
     A small difference between them means the model is learning well and can work on new data.

2.	How can you use TensorBoard to detect overfitting?
ANS: In TensorBoard, you can check the training and validation loss graphs. 
     If the training loss keeps going down but the validation loss starts going up, the model is overfitting.
     You can also compare accuracy graphsâ€”if training accuracy is much higher than validation accuracy, overfitting is happening. 
     Watching these patterns helps decide when to stop training or adjust the model.

3.  What happens when you increase the number of epochs?
ANS: When you increase the number of epochs, the model keeps learning from the data. 
     At first, both training and validation accuracy improve, but after some point, the model may start overfitting.
     This means the training accuracy stays high, but validation accuracy stops improving or gets worse.
     Choosing the right number of epochs helps the model learn well without overfitting.
