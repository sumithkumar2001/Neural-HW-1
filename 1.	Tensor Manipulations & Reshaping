CODE:

import numpy as np

# Step 1: Create a random tensor of shape (4, 6)
tensor = np.random.uniform(size=(4, 6))

# Step 2: Find rank and shape
rank = np.ndim(tensor)
shape = np.shape(tensor)
print(f"Original Tensor Rank: {rank}, Shape: {shape}")

# Step 3: Reshape to (2, 3, 4) and transpose to (3, 2, 4)
reshaped_tensor = np.reshape(tensor, (2, 3, 4))
transposed_tensor = np.transpose(reshaped_tensor, (1, 0, 2))
print(f"Reshaped Tensor Shape: {reshaped_tensor.shape}")
print(f"Transposed Tensor Shape: {transposed_tensor.shape}")

# Step 4: Broadcasting a smaller tensor (1, 4) to match (3, 2, 4)
small_tensor = np.random.uniform(size=(1, 4))
